This is the repositery that contains my master thesis: "Electrophysiological measurement virtual instrumentation". The thesis is written in Serbian and has an abstract in English.

# Abstract
"Electrophysiological signals are representing the electrical activity of biological cells
and tissues (e.g. nerve, cardiac, muscle, etc.). Virtual instruments, compared to
traditional, are characterized by software that carries out the functions of multiple
instruments. All virtual instruments for the analysis of electrophysiological signals in
this paper are designed in the programming package LabVIEW 2013. Suggested
platform for the development of electrophysiological measurement
instrumentation consists of a development board BIGPIC5 and MikroC development
environment, ModularEEG device and designed virtual instruments."
